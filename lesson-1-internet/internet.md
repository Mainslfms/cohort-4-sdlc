# Internet Basics

## What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols. It enables the sharing of information, resources, and services across the world.


## Key Concepts
- **IP Address**: A unique identifier for devices on a network.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols used for transferring data on the web.

   - Go to the "Network" tab.
   - Refresh the page and observe the network activity.
   - Look at the requests being made, the response times, and the types of resources being loaded (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

## Notes 
- The Internet is a network of networks.
- It connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
- There are four main of requests depending on the type of data being sent:
  - GET: Retrieve data from a server.
  - POST: Send data to a server.
  - PUT: Update existing data on a server.
  - DELETE: Remove data from a server.
- The Internet is built on a set of protocols that define how data is transmitted and received.
- Websites are built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Websites are software that run on the Internet. Similar to how a car is a piece of software/hardware that runs on the road.
