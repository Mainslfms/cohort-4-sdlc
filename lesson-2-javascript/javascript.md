# History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in **1995** by **Brendan Eich** while working at Netscape. It was initially developed in just 10 days and was originally called **Mocha**, later renamed to **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript** to align with the popularity of Java at the time.

## Why Was JavaScript Created?
- To make web pages **interactive** and **dynamic**.
- It was designed as a lightweight scripting language for browsers.
- Aimed to complement Java and other programming languages by handling client-side tasks.

## Why Do We Use JavaScript?
- **Interactivity**: Enables features like form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates.
- **Versatility**: Runs on both client-side (browsers) and server-side (Node.js).
- **Popularity**: Supported by all major browsers and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Allows developers to use a single language for both front-end and back-end.

JavaScript remains a cornerstone of modern web development due to its flexibility and widespread adoption.

## JavaScript in the Browser
JavaScript is primarily used in web browsers to enhance user experience. It allows developers to create interactive elements, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and respond to user events.
JavaScript code can be embedded directly in HTML files or linked as external scripts. When a web page is loaded, the browser interprets and executes the JavaScript code, enabling dynamic behavior.

## JavaScript in the Server
JavaScript can also be used on the server side, primarily through **Node.js**. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It enables server-side scripting, allowing developers to build scalable and efficient web applications.
