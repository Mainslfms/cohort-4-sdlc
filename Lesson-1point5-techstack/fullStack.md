# Classic Tech Stack Overview

A classic tech stack typically consists of the following layers:

## 1. Frontend (Client-Side)
- **Purpose**: Handles the user interface and user experience.
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- **Role**: Sends requests to the backend and displays data to the user.

## 2. Backend (Server-Side)
- **Purpose**: Processes business logic, handles requests, and interacts with the database.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails, Java (Spring), or PHP.
- **Role**: Receives requests from the frontend, processes them, and sends responses.

## 3. Database
- **Purpose**: Stores and retrieves data.
- **Technologies**: SQL-based (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL-based (MongoDB, Cassandra).
- **Role**: Provides persistent storage for application data.

## 4. Server/Hosting
- **Purpose**: Hosts the application and serves it to users.
- **Technologies**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or platforms like Heroku and Netlify.
- **Role**: Ensures the application is accessible over the internet.

## 5. Version Control & Collaboration
- **Purpose**: Tracks code changes and facilitates teamwork.
- **Technologies**: Git, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- **Role**: Manages source code and supports collaboration.

## How They Fit Together
1. The **frontend** sends user requests to the **backend**.
2. The **backend** processes the request, interacts with the **database**, and sends a response.
3. The **frontend** displays the response to the user.
4. The application is hosted on a **server**, making it accessible online.
5. Developers use **version control** to manage and collaborate on the codebase.

This stack forms the foundation of many modern web applications.
